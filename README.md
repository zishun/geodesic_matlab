# Exact geodesic for triangular meshes

This is an implementation of geodesic (shortest path) algorithm for triangular meshes, written by Danil Kirsanov. The C++ code is hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/geodesic/) and the Matlab interface is from [Matlab File Exchange](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18168-exact-geodesic-for-triangular-meshes).

The code and compiled Windows dynamic-link libraries are originally released on 2008, which are quite old and do not work on modern PCs. The maintainer of this repository modified the code to make it easy to use, following Fritz and Dean Mark's [comments](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18168-exact-geodesic-for-triangular-meshes).

For algorithm details, please refer to [readme](./src/#readme).
